\subsection{Ethics Assessment}

This project uses naturalistic driving data collected by VTTI (Virginia tech transportation institute) for the purpose of studying human behaviour and developing safety systems that benefits the community and the research field. The study sensor data and on-board videos from more than 3,100 volunteers and up to 2 years of driving under everyday conditions \cite{shrp2}. When working with such data, it is very important to respect the privacy and integrity of the studied subjects and always preserve their anonymity. For this reason, all the team members underwent an online ethics course which introduced them to how to treat data collected from human subjects and to what are the possible ethical risks associated to the use of NDS.

The data used in this project is secured in safety rooms on specific computers. The rooms have restricted access and the team members got access to the rooms after completing the online ethics course mentioned above. By gaining access to the data, the team members pledged to follow the terms and conditions set by VTTI and always keep the privacy of the human subjects as a priority in this research.
