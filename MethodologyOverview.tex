In order to develop a tool for data annotation, some steps are to be taken. First, some frames of reference will be defined that will be used throughout the report. Then a description of how to rectify an image for its intrinsic and extrinsic parameter is shown. The extrinsic rectification discussed relies on the lane lines which brings up the importance of discussing lane tracking. After that, three main parameters of the POV are calculated: its heading angle, lateral offset and longitudinal range with respect to the SV. Some vehicle tracking techniques are also discussed.

Finally, this tool requires a GUI, which is described in details in this section, to interact with the user.
